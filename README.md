# DSS Factory Location

A Web Based Project Decision Support System (DSS) for Factory Location Selection using Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) Method.

## Overview

This project is a Decision Support System designed to assist organizations in selecting the most suitable location for a factory. The system evaluates multiple alternative locations based on various criteria, using established decision-making SAW method.
**This project is developed to fulfill the final project for the Decision Support System course 2024/2025.**

## Features

- Input and manage alternative factory locations
- Define and adjust evaluation criteria and their weights
- Automated calculation and ranking of the best locations
- Visualization of decision results and rankings
- User-friendly interface for data entry and result interpretation

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madliners/DSS-Factory-Location.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd DSS-Factory-Location
   ```

3. **Follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the documentation or relevant files in this repository.**

## Technologies Used

- **Python**  
  The main programming language used for developing the backend logic and decision-making algorithms.

- **Flask**  
  A lightweight web framework for building the web application and handling HTTP requests.

- **Pandas**  
  Used for data manipulation and analysis, especially for processing criteria and alternatives.

- **NumPy**  
  Provides support for numerical operations and matrix calculations required in decision-making methods.

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**  
  For building the user interface, displaying forms, and visualizing results.

- **Bootstrap**  
  A CSS framework to create responsive and visually appealing web pages.

- **Matplotlib / Plotly**  
  Used for visualizing data and displaying charts or graphs of the decision results.

- **Git**

## Usage

1. Add the alternative locations and relevant criteria into the system.
2. Assign weights to each criterion according to your preferences or organizational needs.
3. Run the decision-making process to obtain a ranked list of the best factory locations.
4. Review the results and visualizations to support your final decision.
